            <b>Question: 1. Explain at least ten activities that are considered as cybercrime.</b>
            
            <p><b>Answer: </b> Cybercrime refers to illegal activities conducted using computers, digital devices, or the internet to commit 
                fraud, theft, disruption, or harm to individuals, <br> organizations, or governments. These crimes can range from financial 
                fraud to serious national security threats. As technology evolves, cybercriminals continue <br> to find new ways to exploit 
                vulnerabilities. Below are ten activities that are considered cybercrimes: <br><br> <b>1. Hacking</b> <br> Hacking refers to 
                unauthorized access to a computer system, network, or database to steal, modify, or manipulate data. Hackers often exploit 
                security weaknesses <br> in software and systems to gain access to sensitive information. Ethical hacking exists, but malicious 
                hacking is a punishable cybercrime. <br> <b>2. Identity Theft</b> <br> Cybercriminals steal personal information such as Social 
                Security numbers, banking details, or login credentials to commit fraud or impersonate someone else. <br> Identity theft can lead 
                to financial loss, damaged credit scores, and legal complications for the victim. <br> <b>3. Phishing</b> <br> Phishing is a cybercrime 
                in which attackers send deceptive emails, messages, or websites to trick individuals into revealing personal information, such as passwords <br> 
                and financial details. These scams often impersonate trusted organizations to make victims believe they are providing information to a 
                legitimate source. <br> <b>4. Cyberstalking</b> <br> Cyberstalking involves using digital platforms to harass, threaten, or intimidate 
                someone. Stalkers may send repeated unwanted messages, post false accusations, or <br> track an individualâ€™s online activity without consent. 
                This can have serious psychological and legal consequences for the victim. <br> <b>5. Ransomware Attacks</b> <br> In a ransomware attack, 
                hackers infect a victimâ€™s computer or network with malicious software that locks files or entire systems. The attacker then demands a ransom <br> 
                in exchange for restoring access. Ransomware has affected businesses, hospitals, and government agencies, causing significant financial and operational 
                damage. <br> <b>6. Online Fraud and Scams</b> <br> Online fraud includes deceptive practices such as fake e-commerce websites, lottery scams, and investment 
                fraud. Victims are lured into making payments for products <br> or services that do not exist or are misrepresented, leading to financial losses. <br> <b>
                7. Spreading Malware and Viruses</b> <br> Cybercriminals create and distribute malware, including viruses, trojans, and spyware, to compromise systems. 
                These malicious programs can steal data, monitor user <br> activity, or disrupt system functionality, leading to security breaches and financial losses. <br> <b>
                8. Child Exploitation and Abuse</b> <br> Cybercriminals engage in illegal activities such as distributing child pornography, grooming minors for exploitation, 
                and engaging in other forms of digital abuse. <br> Governments and law enforcement agencies work to track and punish offenders who use the internet for such crimes. <br> <b>
                9. Cyberterrorism</b> <br> Cyberterrorism involves attacks on digital infrastructure to disrupt national security, government operations, or financial systems. 
                Terrorist groups may use cyber <br> methods to spread propaganda, hack into critical systems, or launch attacks on key services. <br> <b>
                10. Data Breaches</b> <br> Data breaches occur when cybercriminals gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored by companies or institutions. 
                This data may include customer details, <br> financial records, or confidential business information, which can be misused or sold on the dark web. <br><br> 
                Cybercrime continues to evolve as technology advances, making it essential for individuals and organizations to stay vigilant against threats. Governments worldwide <br> 
                have introduced strict laws and cybersecurity measures to combat digital crimes and protect users. Cybersecurity awareness, strong passwords, and cautious online <br> 
                behavior can help reduce the risk of falling victim to cybercriminal activities. Additionally, ethical hacking and cybersecurity professionals play a critical role <br> 
                in identifying vulnerabilities and strengthening security systems to prevent cyber threats. 
            </p>

            <b>Question: 2. What do you mean by malicious software? Explain any ten malicious software attacks.</b>

            <p><b>Answer: </b> Malicious software, commonly known as malware, refers to any software or program designed to infiltrate, 
                damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems, <br> networks, or devices. Malware is created with the 
                intent of causing harm, stealing data, or taking control of a system for financial gain, espionage, or sabotage. <br> 
                Cybercriminals use different types of malware to exploit system vulnerabilities and target individuals, businesses, or government 
                institutions. Below are ten common types of <br> malicious software attacks: <br><br> <b>1. Virus</b> <br> A virus is a type of malware 
                that attaches itself to a legitimate file or program and spreads when the infected file is executed. It can corrupt, delete, or alter 
                files, <br> slow down system performance, and even make a system unusable. Viruses often spread through email attachments, infected downloads, 
                or removable storage devices. <br> <b>2. Worm</b> <br> A worm is a self-replicating malware that spreads without any user interaction. 
                Unlike a virus, it does not need to attach itself to a file. Worms can rapidly multiply, <br> consuming system resources, slowing down networks, 
                and causing major disruptions to business operations and infrastructure. <br> <b>3. Trojan Horse</b> <br> A trojan horse is malware disguised as 
                legitimate software to trick users into downloading and installing it. Once activated, it can create backdoors for hackers, steal <br> sensitive information, 
                or cause system malfunctions. Trojans are often spread through fake software downloads, phishing emails, or infected links. <br> <b>
                4. Ransomware</b> <br> Ransomware encrypts files or locks users out of their devices and demands payment (ransom) in exchange for restoring access. Attackers 
                often threaten to delete files or <br> leak sensitive data if the ransom is not paid. This type of attack has severely impacted businesses, hospitals, and 
                government institutions worldwide. <br> <b>5. Spyware</b> <br> Spyware is designed to secretly monitor user activities and collect personal information without consent. 
                It can track keystrokes, steal login credentials, and capture <br> browsing history. Spyware is often bundled with free software, malicious ads, or email attachments. <br> <b>
                6. Adware</b> <br> Adware is a type of malware that automatically displays unwanted advertisements on a user's device. While it may not always be harmful, adware can slow down system <br> 
                performance, redirect web searches, and track user behavior to serve targeted ads. Some adware variants also install additional malware on infected systems. <br> <b>7. Rootkit</b> <br> 
                A rootkit is a sophisticated form of malware that allows hackers to gain deep access (root-level access) to a system while remaining hidden. Rootkits can disable security <br> features, steal 
                sensitive data, and allow cybercriminals to remotely control infected devices. They are often installed through phishing attacks or exploited system <br> vulnerabilities. <br> <b>8. Keylogger</b> <br> 
                A keylogger is a type of spyware that records every keystroke typed by the user, capturing sensitive data such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details. Keyloggers <br> are often used in 
                cyber espionage or financial fraud. They can be installed through malicious software, phishing emails, or compromised websites. <br> <b>9. Botnet</b> <br> A botnet consists 
                of multiple compromised computers (bots) controlled remotely by cybercriminals. These infected devices can be used for large-scale cyberattacks such as <br> Distributed Denial 
                of Service (DDoS) attacks, email spamming, and data theft. Botnets are typically created using malware infections that spread across networks. <br> <b>10. Fileless Malware</b> <br> 
                Unlike traditional malware that requires files to execute, fileless malware operates within the systemâ€™s memory, making it difficult to detect. It exploits trusted system <br> processes 
                to execute malicious commands without leaving traces on the hard drive. Fileless malware is commonly used in targeted cyberattacks against organizations. <br><br> Malware attacks pose serious threats to 
                individuals, businesses, and governments. Cybercriminals continuously develop new variants to bypass security measures and exploit <br> vulnerabilities. To protect against malware, users should install and update 
                antivirus software, avoid suspicious links and email attachments, regularly update their <br> operating systems, and be cautious when downloading files from unknown sources. Additionally, organizations should implement 
                strong cybersecurity policies, use network <br> monitoring tools, and educate employees about potential threats to minimize risks. 
            </p>

            <b>Question: 3. Explain intellectual property along with its types in detail. What legal provisions do we have in Nepal to preserve intellectual property rights?</b>

            <p><b>Answer: </b> Intellectual Property (IP) refers to creations of the mind, including inventions, literary and artistic 
                works, designs, symbols, names, and images used in commerce. <br> Intellectual property rights (IPR) provide legal protection 
                to creators and innovators, ensuring that they can benefit from their work while preventing unauthorized <br> use by others. 
                Protecting intellectual property is essential for promoting creativity, innovation, and economic growth. <br><br> Intellectual 
                property is broadly categorized into the following types: <br><br> <b>1. Copyright</b> <br> Copyright protects original works of authorship, 
                such as books, music, films, paintings, software, and architectural designs. It grants the creator exclusive rights <br> to reproduce, distribute, 
                perform, display, or modify their work. Copyright usually lasts for the creatorâ€™s lifetime plus a certain number of years after their death. <br> <b>
                2. Trademark</b> <br> A trademark is a unique symbol, logo, word, phrase, or design that distinguishes a businessâ€™s goods or services from others 
                in the market. Trademarks help consumers <br> identify and trust brands while preventing others from using similar marks that could cause confusion. 
                Well-known trademarks include company logos like Apple, Nike, <br> and Coca-Cola. <br> <b>3. Patent</b> <br> A patent is a legal right granted to 
                inventors for new and useful inventions, providing exclusive rights to manufacture, use, and sell their invention for a specific <br> period 
                (usually 20 years). Patents encourage technological advancement by ensuring inventors can benefit from their creations while making knowledge 
                publicly available <br> after the patent expires. <br> <b>4. Industrial Design</b> <br> Industrial design refers to the aesthetic aspects 
                of a product, such as its shape, color, and pattern. Protecting industrial designs ensures that businesses can maintain <br> uniqueness 
                and prevent imitation of their product designs. Examples include the shape of a luxury car, packaging of consumer goods, or the appearance 
                of electronic devices. <br> <b>5. Trade Secret</b> <br> A trade secret consists of confidential business information that provides a company 
                with a competitive advantage. This includes formulas, manufacturing processes, customer <br> lists, and marketing strategies. Unlike patents, 
                trade secrets do not require public disclosure but must be actively protected by the business. A well-known example of a trade <br> secret 
                is the secret recipe for Coca-Cola. <br> <b>6. Geographical Indications (GI)</b> <br> A Geographical Indication is a sign used on products that 
                originate from a specific place and have qualities or reputations linked to that location. Examples include <br> Darjeeling Tea, Champagne, 
                and Basmati Rice. GI protection helps preserve traditional knowledge and promotes regional products in global markets. <br><br> <b>Legal 
                Provisions for Intellectual Property Rights in Nepal</b> <br><br> Nepal has several laws and regulations to protect intellectual property 
                rights and prevent infringement. The major legal provisions include: <br><br> <b>1. Copyright Act, 2059 (2002)</b> <br> This act protects 
                literary, artistic, and musical works, providing copyright holders with exclusive rights over reproduction, distribution, and 
                adaptation of their work. <br> It also specifies penalties for copyright violations and unauthorized use of protected works. <br> <b>
                2. Patent, Design and Trademark Act, 2022 (1965)</b> <br> This law regulates patents, trademarks, and industrial designs in Nepal. It grants 
                inventors and businesses exclusive rights over their patents for 20 years, while <br> trademarks and industrial designs are protected for a 
                renewable period of time. The act also includes provisions for dispute resolution in case of infringement. <br> <b>3. Consumer Protection Act, 
                2075 (2018)</b> <br> This act ensures the protection of consumers from counterfeit goods and misleading trademarks. It aims to maintain fair trade 
                practices and safeguard consumers from <br> substandard or pirated products that violate intellectual property rights. <br> <b>
                4. Information Technology Act, 2057 (2000)</b> <br> This law helps regulate digital and software-related intellectual property issues, including 
                cybercrimes, data protection, and copyright enforcement for digital content. <br> <b>5. Nepalâ€™s Membership in International Treaties</b> <br> Nepal 
                is a member of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and a signatory to several international agreements, such as the Berne Convention 
                for copyright <br> protection and the Paris Convention for patent and trademark protection. These treaties help Nepal align its IP laws with global 
                standards. <br><br> Protecting intellectual property is vital for encouraging innovation, economic growth, and fair competition. Nepal has 
                made progress in strengthening its IP laws, but <br> challenges such as piracy, counterfeiting, and enforcement issues still exist. Proper 
                implementation of legal frameworks, public awareness, and stricter enforcement <br> can enhance the protection of intellectual property rights 
                in Nepal. 
            </p>

            <b>Question: 4. Explain digital signature along with its working mechanism.</b>

            <p><b>Answer: </b> A digital signature is a cryptographic technique used to ensure the authenticity, integrity, and 
                non-repudiation of digital messages or documents. It acts as a virtual <br> fingerprint that uniquely identifies 
                the sender and confirms that the content has not been altered during transmission. Digital signatures are widely 
                used in secure <br> communications, online transactions, software distribution, and legal document verification. 
                <br><br> Digital signatures are based on public-key cryptography (asymmetric encryption), where a pair of keysâ€”private 
                and publicâ€”are used to sign and verify digital data. <br> The private key is used to generate the signature, while the 
                public key is used to verify it. <br><br> <b>Working Mechanism of Digital Signature</b> <br><br> Digital signatures 
                involve a multi-step process that ensures data security and authenticity: <br><br> <b>1. Hashing the Message</b> <br> 
                Before applying a digital signature, the original document or message is passed through a cryptographic hash function, 
                which converts the content into a fixed-length hash <br> value. This hash is unique to the original message, meaning 
                even a slight modification in the data will produce a completely different hash. <br> <b>2. Encrypting the Hash with a 
                Private Key</b> <br> The sender uses their private key to encrypt the hash value, creating the digital signature. 
                This step ensures that only the sender, who possesses the private key, can <br> generate the signature, confirming 
                authenticity. <br> <b>3. Attaching the Digital Signature to the Document</b> <br> The generated digital signature 
                is appended to the original message or document before being sent to the recipient. Along with the message, the 
                sender also shares their <br> public key, which is necessary for verification. <br> <b>4. Decrypting the Hash with 
                the Public Key</b> <br> Upon receiving the message, the recipient uses the sender's public key to decrypt the 
                attached digital signature, obtaining the original hash value. <br> <b>5. Recalculating the Hash for Verification</b> <br> 
                The recipient independently computes the hash of the received document using the same cryptographic hash function applied by the sender. 
                This newly calculated hash is <br> then compared to the decrypted hash value from the digital signature. <br> <b>6. Validating the 
                Digital Signature</b> <br> - If both hash values match, it confirms that the document has not been altered and that the sender 
                is authenticated. The digital signature is considered valid. <br> - If the hash values do not match, it indicates that the 
                document has been tampered with or the sender's identity is not verified. The digital signature is invalid. <br><br> <b>
                Importance of Digital Signatures</b> <br><br> Digital signatures provide the following security features: <br><br> <b>
                1. Authentication:</b> Ensures that the message or document was signed by the claimed sender. <br> <b>
                2. Integrity:</b> Confirms that the content has not been modified after being signed. <br> <b>3. Non-repudiation:</b> 
                Prevents the sender from denying their involvement in signing the document. <br><br> Digital signatures are widely used in 
                electronic contracts, government documents, software authentication, and secure emails. By ensuring authenticity and integrity, 
                <br> they help establish trust in digital communications and prevent fraud. 
            </p>
