        1. **Definition, Characteristics, and Application of Computer** <br>
   - A **computer** is an electronic device capable of performing calculations, storing, retrieving, and processing data. <br>
   - **Characteristics**: Speed, Accuracy, Automation, Storage, Versatility, Diligence, and Connectivity. <br>
   - **Applications**: Education, Business, Healthcare, Government, Entertainment, and Communication. <br>

2. **Evolution of Computer Technology** <br>
   - **First Generation (1940-1956)**: Vacuum tubes, large and expensive (e.g., ENIAC). <br>
   - **Second Generation (1956-1963)**: Transistors replaced vacuum tubes, smaller and more efficient. <br>
   - **Third Generation (1964-1971)**: Integrated Circuits (ICs) improved performance and size. <br>
   - **Fourth Generation (1971-Present)**: Microprocessors, personal computers, and the rise of the internet. <br>
   - **Fifth Generation (Future)**: Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Computing. <br>

3. **Measurement Unit of Processing Speed and Storage Unit** <br>
   - **Processing Speed**: Measured in Hz (Hertz), KHz, MHz, and GHz. <br>
   - **Storage**: Byte (B), Kilobyte (KB), Megabyte (MB), Gigabyte (GB), Terabyte (TB). <br>

4. **Supercomputers, Mainframe, Mini, and Microcomputers** <br>
   - **Supercomputers**: Extremely fast and powerful, used for complex simulations. <br>
   - **Mainframe Computers**: Large, powerful, used for bulk data processing. <br>
   - **Mini Computers**: Medium-sized, used by small organizations. <br>
   - **Microcomputers**: Personal computers (PCs), widely used in homes and offices. <br>

5. **Mobile Computing and its Application**
   - Mobile computing refers to the ability to use computing devices wirelessly while moving. <br>
    It includes smartphones, laptops, tablets,and mobile apps for communication, entertainment, and productivity. 

#### 1.2 Computer System and I/O Devices

1. **Computer Architecture and Organization**
   - Describes how the components of a computer work together to perform tasks:  <br>
   **Input Unit**, **Processing Unit**, **Memory Unit**, and **Output Unit**.

2. **Components of Computer System** <br>
   - **Input Unit**: Keyboard, mouse, scanner. <br>
   - **Output Unit**: Monitor, printer, speakers. <br>
   - **Processing Unit**: Central Processing Unit (CPU), where all processing occurs. <br>
   - **Memory Unit**: RAM (temporary), ROM (permanent storage), Cache (for faster access). <br>

3. **Microprocessor** <br>
   - A microprocessor is the brain of the computer, responsible for processing data. <br>
   - **Clock Speed**: Determines how fast the microprocessor can process data (measured in GHz). <br>
   - **Word Length**: Refers to the number of bits the processor can handle at a time (e.g., 32-bit, 64-bit). <br>

4. **Bus System** <br>
   - **Data Bus**: Carries data between components. <br>
   - **Address Bus**: Carries memory addresses. <br>
   - **Control Bus**: Carries control signals to coordinate actions. <br>

5. **Primary Memory** <br>
   - **RAM**: Volatile, temporary memory. <br>
   - **ROM**: Non-volatile, permanent memory. <br>
   - **Cache**: Small, high-speed memory used to store frequently accessed data. <br>

6. **Secondary Memory** <br>
   - **Magnetic Disk**: Hard drives and floppy disks. <br>
   - **Flash Memory**: SSDs, USB drives. <br>
   - **Optical Disk**: CDs, DVDs. <br>
   - **External Storage Devices**: External hard drives, cloud storage. <br>

7. **Input Devices**
   - Devices such as **keyboard**, **mouse**, **scanner**, **light pen**, <br>
    **OMR**, **OCR**, **BCR**, **MICR**, **microphone**, and **digital cameras**  <br>
    used to enter data into a computer.

8. **Output Devices**
   - Devices like **monitors** (LCD, LED), **printers** (Dot Matrix, Inkjet, Laser), <br>
    and **speakers** used to display or produce results. <br>

9. **Hardware Interfaces**
   - **Ports**: **Parallel**, **Serial**, **USB**, **HDMI**. <br>
   - **Expansion Slots**: Used for adding additional components (e.g., sound cards, network cards). <br>
